In a Firebase project, when using Cloud Functions with background triggers, the function might not execute reliably if the trigger event data is too large. Firebase has limitations on the size of the data it can process in a single function invocation. If the event data exceeds these limits, the function might fail silently without any clear error messages in the logs. This is an uncommon error because it's not a typical runtime error but rather a data size limitation that is not always explicitly documented.
